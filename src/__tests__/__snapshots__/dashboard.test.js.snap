              zeroDAO is an Ethereum Blockchain layer 2 solution enabling cross-chain liquidity through various means, including the RenVM. zeroDAO is a decentralized community of zeroDAO users holding the [LP] token, which is a cryptographic governance token used in the zeroDAO protocol (together, the “Open Source Software”) that permits, among other things, the ability to create and participate in liquidity pools. [LP] token holders may use their [LP] tokens to collectively govern certain rules of use of the Open Source Software, including participation in voting over some key aspects of the Open Source Software or the zeroDAO project (the “Voting”). Any [LP] token holder may participate in any Voting by independently interacting with the relevant smart contracts within the Open Source Software (the “Voting Contracts”). Some members and developers of the zeroDAO community and its Open Source Software (collectively the “zeroDAO Volunteers”) have provided you with a user interface, including the one available at zeroDAO.com and via other tools (the “Site”) — which includes text, files, images, audio, code and other materials (collectively, the “Content”) and all of the features, and services provided. The Site, the Voting Contracts, and any other features, tools, materials, the Open Source Software, or other services offered from time to time are referred to here as the “Service”.

This warning and others later provided by ZD and zeroDAO Volunteers in no way evidence or represent an ongoing duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Service or Content.

This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.

              The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent [include name and address of registered agent here]. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS's rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, ZD will pay them for you. In addition, ZD will reimburse all such JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.

              You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

               The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and ZD. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

               You and ZD are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Applicability or Arbitration Agreement section above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
